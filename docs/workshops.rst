IAVCEI Modelling Volatile Behaviour in Magmas Workshop 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Volatiles are a critical component of magmas, driving volcanic eruptions, creating and modifying planetary atmospheres, and generating ore deposits. There has been an immense amount of work quantifying the solubility of individual volatile species in a wide variety of magma compositions and the creation of various modelling capabilities to look at magmatic degassing. This workshop aims to bring together experimentalists, numerical modellers, and observational researchers with an interest in volatile solubility in magmas. Through group discussions, model demonstrations, and keynote talks, we will explore the current landscape and look for future directions. We will start with a demonstration session of existing models and codes. There is currently no benchmarking for such codes, so we will discuss options for a benchmarking exercise and test datasets. This will be followed by discussions on future directions, covering: (1) what are the experimental gaps (e.g., melt compositions, volatile species, PT ranges, fugacity coefficients, non-ideal mixing, etc.); (2) what do observational researchers need these codes to be able to do; (3) how would we incorporate disequilibrium/isotopic fractionation, (4) how do we incorporate interaction with hydrothermal systems, and (5) can we link monitoring needs to solubility outputs? This workshop will be hybrid, with the opportunity for pre-submitted talks/written work, and a summary of the workshop will be released afterwards, with the opportunity for comment, to ensure as many people as possible can participate. There is scope for exploring a dedicated special issue on this topic following this workshop.
