Importing VESIcal
=================
Start with this:

.. code-block:: python

	import VESIcal as v

Creating a VESIcal Sample
=========================
VESIcal allows you to perform calculations on a single sample, either defined as a dictionary or pulled from a supplied Excel or CSV file, or on an entire dataset, supplied by an Excel or CSV file. To define a single sample manually, create a dictionary with oxide names as keys and oxide concentrations as values. Note that you are defining a bulk system here, so the H2O and CO2 concentrations refer to those oxides in the entire melt +/- fluid system, not just dissolved in the melt.

Define a single sample manually, like this:

.. code-block:: python

	my_sample = v.Sample({'SiO2':  77.3, 
         'TiO2':   0.08, 
         'Al2O3': 12.6, 
         'Fe2O3':  0.207,
         'Cr2O3':  0.0, 
         'FeO':    0.473, 
         'MnO':    0.0,
         'MgO':    0.03, 
         'NiO':    0.0, 
         'CoO':    0.0,
         'CaO':    0.43, 
         'Na2O':   3.98, 
         'K2O':    4.88, 
         'P2O5':   0.0, 
         'H2O':    6.5,
         'CO2':    0.05})

You can also extract a sample from a provided Excel or CSV file and save it to a variable. In this example, we have imported an Excel file to a variable named `myfile` and wish to extract the sample named 'SampleOne' (also see Import an Excel or CSV File below):

.. code-block:: python

	extracted_sample = myfile.get_sample_composition('SampleOne', asSampleClass=True)

Import an Excel or CSV file
===========================
You can import an Excel or CSV file containing compositional data describing your samples using the `BatchFile` class. Your file should have each sample in a separate row, with data in terms of oxides. You can pass the optional argument `input_type` if oxide concentrations are not in wt% (options are 'wtpercent' (default), 'molpercent', and 'molfrac'). You can pass the optional argument 'label' to define the column title referring to the column containing sample names. The default value is 'Label'.

.. code-block:: python

	v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx')

You'll want to save this BatchFile object to a variable. Do that like this:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx')

If your excel file has multiple sheets, you can specify which sheet to import. Note that you can only import one sheet at a time.

.. code-block:: python

	myfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx', sheet_name="SameOfYourSheet")

You can also specify the sheet name by it's number (e.g. the 1st, 2nd, 3rd... sheet in the file) as:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx', sheet_name=0) #import the first sheet
	myotherfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx', sheet_name=4) #import the fifth sheet


Handling Sample and BatchFile normalization and units
=====================================================
By default, VESIcal assumes your data are input in terms of wt% oxides and applies no normalization to your data. You may wish to normalize your dataset (using one of VESIcal's three normalization routines) after import, translate your wt% oxide data into some other units (mol fraction oxides or cations), or you may with to import data already in terms of mol fraction oxides or cations (in which case, you need to inform VESIcal of this, otherwise it will assume the values are in wt% oxides).

To normalize a dataset upon import, use the `default_normalizaion` argument when creating your Sample or BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	my_sample = v.Sample({'SiO2':  77.3, 
         'TiO2':   0.08, 
         'Al2O3': 12.6, 
         'Fe2O3':  0.207,
         'Cr2O3':  0.0, 
         'FeO':    0.473, 
         'MnO':    0.0,
         'MgO':    0.03, 
         'NiO':    0.0, 
         'CoO':    0.0,
         'CaO':    0.43, 
         'Na2O':   3.98, 
         'K2O':    4.88, 
         'P2O5':   0.0, 
         'H2O':    6.5,
         'CO2':    0.05},
         default_normalization='standard')

.. code-block:: python

	myfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx.xlsx', default_normalization='standard')

To convert units from wt% oxides to something else (in this example, mol fraction oxides) upon import, use the `default_units` argument when creating your Sample or BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	my_sample = v.Sample({'SiO2':  77.3, 
         'TiO2':   0.08, 
         'Al2O3': 12.6, 
         'Fe2O3':  0.207,
         'Cr2O3':  0.0, 
         'FeO':    0.473, 
         'MnO':    0.0,
         'MgO':    0.03, 
         'NiO':    0.0, 
         'CoO':    0.0,
         'CaO':    0.43, 
         'Na2O':   3.98, 
         'K2O':    4.88, 
         'P2O5':   0.0, 
         'H2O':    6.5,
         'CO2':    0.05},
         default_units='mol_oxides')

.. code-block:: python

	myfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx.xlsx', default_units='mol_oxides')

To instruct VESIcal that you are inputting your data in terms of units other than wt% oxides (here mol fraction oxidxes), use the `units` argument when creating your Sample object:

.. code-block:: python

	my_sample = v.Sample({'SiO2':  0.67, 
         'TiO2':   0.00053, 
         'Al2O3':  0.065, 
         'Fe2O3':  0.00068,
         'Cr2O3':  0.0, 
         'FeO':    0.0035, 
         'MnO':    0.0,
         'MgO':    0.00039, 
         'NiO':    0.0, 
         'CoO':    0.0,
         'CaO':    0.0040, 
         'Na2O':   0.0337, 
         'K2O':    0.0272, 
         'P2O5':   0.0, 
         'H2O':    0.189,
         'CO2':    0.0006},
         units='mol_oxides')

.. code-block:: python

	myfile = v.BatchFile('path/to/your/file.xlsx.xlsx', units='mol_oxides')

Note that, by default, your sample composition(s) will be returned to you in wt% oxides unless you also specify `default_units='moloxides'`.

Specific Normalization Types
============================

Before performing model calculations on a dataset, it may be desired to normalize the input composition(s) to a total of 100%. VESIcal has multiple built-in methods for doing so. It should be noted that this procedure is by no means required and not necessarily advised depending on what the user intends to model. 

In some cases, data transformations internal to model calculations (e.g., converting between wt% and mol fraction) in effect cause normalization of the input bulk composition anyways, and so normalizing ahead of time will make no difference in the final modeled result. For example, `calculate_dissolved_volatiles` is agnostic to any a priori normalization of the data since the volatiles are handled separately from the dry bulk. On the other hand, `calculate_saturation_pressure` depends very much on any normalization performed, since the calculated pressure depends directly and strongly on the proportion of volatiles in the bulk composition.

To normalize your dataset upon import, please see the section above. This section will cover working with already imported data in VESIcal.

Standard normalization
----------------------
Returns the composition normalized to 100%, including any volatiles. 

.. code-block:: python

	standard = mysample.get_composition(normalization="standard")

If you wish to update the composition in mysample to the normalized one, you can then do:

.. code-block:: python

	mysample.change_composition(standard)


FixedVolatiles Normalization
----------------------------
Normalizes the oxides to 100%, but volatiles remain fixed while other major element oxides are reduced proporitonally so that the total is 100 wt%.

.. code-block:: python

	fixed = mysample.get_composition(normalization="fixedvolatiles")
	mysample.change_composition(fixed)

AdditionalVolatiles Normalization
---------------------------------
Normalizes oxides to 100% assuming the sample is volatile-free. If H2O or CO2  concentrations are passed to the function, their un-normalized values will be retained in addition to the normalized non-volatile oxides, summing to >100%.

.. code-block:: python

	additional = mysample.get_composition(normalization="additionalvolatiles")
	mysample.change_composition(additional)

Normalize a BatchFile object
----------------------------
One might wish to normalize all samples within a BatchFile object. To do so, you can extract and normalize all of the data from your BatchFile object and then create a new BatchFile object with the now normalized data:

.. code-block:: python

	my_normed_data = myfile.get_data(normalization="standard")
	myNewData = v.BatchFile(filname=None, dataframe=my_normed_data)

The value for normalization can be any of "standard", "fixedvolatiles", or "additionalvolatiles".

General Notes, Tips, and Tricks
===============================

Pull arguments (P, T, X_fluid) from a file
------------------------------------------
For any batch calcultions that take `pressure`, `temperature`, or `X_fluid` arguments, those arguments can either be defined directly in the function call, in which case the one value will be applied to all samples, or the arguments can be passed from the batch file. For example, let's say we have an Excel file, which we've imported into VESIcal and named `myfile`, which contains compositional data, pressure, and temperature values for all of our samples. Our column with temperature values is named "MyTemps", and our column with pressure values is named "SomePs". We will apply one value for X_fluid to the whole dataset. Note that, even if a column of values for X_fluid exists in our Excel file, the following call will ignore it and instead use the value provided for all samples.

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.calculate_dissolved_volatiles(temperature="MyTemps",
						pressure="SomePs",
						X_fluid=0.35).result


Using models other than MagmaSat
--------------------------------
MagmaSat (i.e., MELTS v.1.2.0) is the default model for all function calls. But, one of the great powers of VESIcal is the ability to use any of the supplied models for any function call. You can get a list of all available models by typing:

.. code-block:: python

	v.get_model_names()

which returns a list of model names, as strings.

You can then pass any one of those model names to any calculation, both for batch and single-sample calculations, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string). For example:

.. code-block:: python

	v.calculate_saturation_pressure(sample=<your_sample>,
					temperature=<your_temp>,
					model='ShishkinaIdealMixing').result

print_status
------------
You can print the progress of any batch calcultion by adding

.. code-block:: python

	print_status=True

as an argument to the function call.

verbose
-------
You can make any single sample calculation return extra computed values by adding

.. code-block:: python

	verbose=True

as an argument to the function call. The values returned depend upon the calculation being performed.

Running VESIcal's Core Calculations
===================================

Calculate Dissolved Volatile Concentrations
-------------------------------------------
For an entire dataset, where `myfile` is an BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.calculate_dissolved_volatiles(temperature=<your_temp>, 
						pressure=<your_pressure>, 
						X_fluid=<your_X_fluid>)

Or for a single sample, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	v.calculate_dissolved_volatiles(sample=<your_sample>, 
					temperature=<your_temp>, 
					pressure=<your_pressure>, 
					X_fluid=<your_X_fluid>).result

----------

Calculate Equilibrium Fluid Compositions
----------------------------------------
For an entire dataset, where `myfile` is an BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.calculate_equilibrium_fluid_comp(temperature=<your_temp>, 
						pressure=<your_pressure>)

Or for a single sample, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	v.calculate_equilibrium_fluid_comp(sample=<your_sample>, 
					temperature=<your_temp>, 
					pressure=<your_pressure>).result

----------

Calculate Saturation Pressures
------------------------------
For an entire dataset, where `myfile` is an BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.calculate_saturation_pressure(temperature=<your_temp>)

Or for a single sample, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	v.calculate_saturation_pressure(sample=<your_sample>, 
					temperature=<your_temp>).result

----------

Calculate and Plot Isobars and Isopleths
----------------------------------------
You can only do this for a single sample. First, calculate the isobars and isopleths like so, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	isobars, isopleths = v.calculate_isobars_and_isopleths(sample=<your_sample>, 
                                            temperature=<your_temp>,
                                            pressure_list=[<pressure1>, <pressure2>, <pressure3>],
                                            isopleth_list=[<isopleth1>, <isopleth2>, <isopleth3>].result

Then, you can very easily plot your newly calculated isobars and isopleths, like so:

.. code-block:: python

	fig, ax = v.plot(isobars=isobars, isopleths=isopleths)
	show()

You may wish to do some custom plotting of your isobar and isopleth data without relying on our built-in plot function. However, the raw isobars and isopleths output by the calculate method are a bit messy. `plot_isobars_and_isopleths()` has curve smoothing built-in. We have also implemented the same smoothing in a separate method, called `smooth_isobars_and_isopleths()` which takes isobars and/or isopleths as inputs and returns a pandas DataFrame with smoothed data ready for plotting. Use that function like so:

.. code-block:: python

	v.vplot.smooth_isobars_and_isopleths(isobars=isobars, isopleths=isopleths)

----------

Calculate and Plot Degassing Paths
----------------------------------
You can only do this for a single sample. First, calculate the degassing path. 

Closed-system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example shows the default degassing path, which is closed system degassing with 0% initial fluid. Here, `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string)

.. code-block:: python

	degass_closed = v.calculate_degassing_path(sample=<your_sample>,
					temperature=<your_temp>).result

Closed-system with initial fluid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You might wish to calculate a degassing path for a closed-system, but where your initial magma already contains some percentage of exsolved fluid. In this case, use the `init_vapor` argument. In this example, we calculate the degassing path with 2% initial fluid, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	degass_init = v.calculate_degassing_path(sample=<your_sample>,
					temperature=<your_temp>,
					init_vapor=2.0).result

Open-system
^^^^^^^^^^^
You may with to calculate an open or partially open system degassing path. This is acheived using the `fractionate_vapor` argument. A value of 1.0 is a completely open system, in which 100% of the fluid is removed at each calculation step. A value of 0.2 would represent a partially open system, in which 20% of the fluid is removed at each calculation step. 

A completely open system, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	degass_open = v.calculate_degassing_path(sample=<your_sample>,
					temperature=<your_temp>,
					fractionate_vapor=1.0).result

A partially open system, where 20% of vapor is fractionated at each calculation step, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	degass_partly_open = v.calculate_degassing_path(sample=<your_sample>,
					temperature=<your_temp>,
					fractionate_vapor=0.2).result

You can then easily plot your newly calculated degassing paths like so:

.. code-block:: python

	fig, ax = v.plot(degassing_paths=[degass_closed, degass_init, degass_open, degass_partly_open],
            		degassing_path_labels=["Closed System", "2% Initial Fluid", "Open System", "Partly Open System"])
    v.show()

------------

Running thermo Calculations
===================================

Calculate Liquid Density
-------------------------------------------
For an entire dataset, where `myfile` is an BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.calculate_liquid_density(temperature=<your_temp>, 
						pressure=<your_pressure>)

Or for a single sample, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	v.calculate_liquid_density(sample=<your_sample>, 
					temperature=<your_temp>, 
					pressure=<your_pressure>).result

----------

Calculate Liquid Viscosity
-------------------------------------------
For an entire dataset, where `myfile` is an BatchFile object:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.calculate_liquid_viscosity(temperature=<your_temp>)

Or for a single sample, where `<your_sample>` is a variable (not a string):

.. code-block:: python

	v.calculate_liquid_viscosity(sample=<your_sample>, 
					temperature=<your_temp>).result

----------

Save Your Calculations to an Excel or CSV File
==============================================
Once you have performed some calculations and have assigned their outputs to variables, you can write all of your data to an excel or CSV file or files. Let's assume you have imported a file and written it to a variable called `myfile`. You then performed two calculations: `calculate_dissolved_volatiles()` and `calculate_saturation_pressure()`. You've written those outputs to teh variables `dissolved` and `SatP`, respectively. Here's how you would save these data to an excel file. What gets created is a .xlsx file with the first sheet containing your originally input data, the second sheet containing the dissolved data, and the third sheet containing the SatP data.

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.save_excel("myoutput.xlsx", calculations=[dissolved, SatP])

Optionally, you can tell VESIcal what to name your new sheets in your new excel file:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.save_excel("myoutput.xlsx", calculations=[dissolved, SatP], sheet_names=["My dissolved data", "My saturation data"])

If instead you wish to save these calculations to CSV files, you can do so as:

.. code-block:: python

	myfile.save_csv(filenames=[my_dissolved_output.csv", "my_SatP_output.csv"], calculations=[dissolved, SatP])

Your calculations will be saved to two CSV files: one for each calculation.
