Integration with Thermobar
##########################

Thermobar (Wieser, 2021) is an open-source python3 tool for performing mineral and mineral-melt thermobarometry, hygrometry and chemometry. The Thermobar devs have provided tutorials on how to combine Thermobar calculations with VESIcal, a powerful combination. You can find all Thermobar-VESIcal tutorials at the `Thermobar ReadTheDocs <https://thermobar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples/Integration_with_VESIcal/Combining_VESIcal_Thermobar_SatPs.html>`_.
